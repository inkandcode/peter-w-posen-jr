	<div id="about">
		<p>I am originally from a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. I went to <a href="http://bgsu.edu" title="Bowling Green State University">Bowling Green State University</a>, in Bowling Green, Ohio, where I received a Bachelor's degree in <a href="http://art.bgsu.edu" title="Bowling Green State University">Graphic Design</a>, and was initiated in <a href="http://deltasig.org" title="Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity">Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity</a>. Upon graduation, I moved back to Cleveland and began working for a <a href="http://sparkdesign.com" title="Spark Advertising">design firm</a>. I worked for 3 years on print and web design, and became fascinated by typography.</p>
		<p>Wanting a little bit more flexibility, I left my position at the <a href="http://sparkdesign.com" title="Spark Advertising">design firm</a>, and started splitting my time between working for myself and a <a href="http://universitytees.com" title="University Tees">screen-printing company</a>. This gave me the opportunity to work on-the-road as I travelled the country and abroad, as well as prepare for graduate school.</p>
		<p>Slowly, my work started to shift from print design to web design and development. It was at this time where I began to understand Usability, efficiency of code and design, and User Experience. It was through this understanding that made me want to further my education in the field of Information Architecture.</p>
		<p>After being accepted in IIT's <a href="http://iit.edu/csl/hum/programs/grad/iarc.shtml" title="Information Architecture">Information Architecture Master's program</a>, I moved to Chicago, Illinois in August of 2009.</p>
		<p>Since being in Chicago, I've been in school full-time, but have manage to practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and snowboard, whenever I can get away on the winter weekends.</p>
		<p>Luckily, I love what I do, and want to be involved with graphic, information, and experience design the rest of my life.</p>
		<p>I graduate in May, 2011, and plan on working in the field of User Experience and Information Architecture in Chicago, as well as pursuing a PhD.</p>
